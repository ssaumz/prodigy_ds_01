## Task-01: Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

## Project Overview
Excited to announce the successful completion of Task-01 during my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech ðŸš€. This project involved creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. Specifically, the project was focused on demonstrating proficiency in data visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Objectives
Import and clean data.
Visualize the distribution of a chosen variable using a bar chart or histogram.
Interpret the visualized data to derive meaningful insights.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for writing and running code.
Pandas: Data manipulation library.
Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static plots.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
